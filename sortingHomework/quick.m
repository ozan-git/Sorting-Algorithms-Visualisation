% Performs quick sort algorithm.
% Quick sort algorithm, like merge sort, applies the dive-and-conquer paradigm.
%
% Divide: Partition the array Array[p..r] into two (possibly empty)
% subarrays Array[p..(q-1)] and Array[(q+1)..r]
% such that each element of Array[p..(q-1)] is less than or equal to
% Array[q], which is, in turn, less than or equal to each element of
% Array[(q+1)..r]. Compute the index q as part of this partitioning procedure.
%
% Conquer: Sort the two subarrays Array[p..(q-1)] and Array[(q+1)..r] by
% recursive calls to quicksort.
% Combine: Because the subarrays are already sorted, no work is needed to
% combine them: the entire array Array[p..r]
% is now sorted.
